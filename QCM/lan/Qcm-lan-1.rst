Question 1. Type of errors in the physical layer.
--------------------------------------------------

Which of the following sentences is not an error in the physical layer
?

.. class:: postive

- The value of a bit transmitted is modified.

- The layer may deliver more bits to the receiver than the number of bits sent
  by the sender.
- The layer may deliver fewer bits to the receiver than the number of bits sent
  by the sender


.. class:: negative

- An inversion of all the bits.
  
  .. class:: comment
        
        even if it's eventually "possible" that a physical layer reverse all
        the bits, it's highly unlikely that this kind of error is caused by the
        physical layer.

- An inversion of bits.
