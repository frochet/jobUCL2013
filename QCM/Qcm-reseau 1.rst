Question 2. Distance vector routing
-----------------------------

Question 3. Distance vector routing
-----------------------------

Question 4. Distance vector routing
-----------------------------

The routers from question 1 uses distance vector routing. They sends their distance vector regularly over all theirs interfaces. Wich one of these 
sequences of message could have been generated by the network from question 1?

     Read Computer Networking : Principles, Protocols and Practice section 5.1.2 : The control plane.




Question 5. Failure with Distance Vector Routing
--------------------------------------------------------------

Consider that the network reach a state where the router A, C, D have receive
distance vector from each of them. For an unknown reason, these routers have
never heard about B and E. Then, the link between the router A and D fail. What
will happen ?

 .. figure:: ../png/qcm1-3.png 
     :align: center
     :scale: 100
 
.. class:: positive

- Routers A and D notice after a sufficient delay (How much ?) that they own a route which
  is too old. The next distance vector for A will be [A=0, D=inf, C=3] and the next
  distance vector for D will be [ D=0, A=inf, C=3]. Then C share its distance vector
  to A and D and the failure is recovered.


.. class:: negative

- Routers A and D notice after a sufficient delay (How much ?) that they own a route which
  is too old. The next distance vector for A will be [A=0, C=3, D=inf B=inf, E=inf] and the next
  distance vector for D will be [D=0, A=inf, C=3, B=inf, E=inf].


- Either router A or router D notice first the failure (let's say that A notice
  first) and sent its vector routing to the others with inside D=inf. When router C
  receive the distance vector, it updates its own distance vector and sent it
  to D. Thanks to that, D notice the failure and update its distance vector to
  [A=6, C=3, D=0]

.. class:: comment

      It could be useful to read again the chapter Distance Vector Routing, where you will find a complete example about failure. The pseudo-code in this chapter could help you to understand correctly the algorithm.


Question 6. The count to infinity problem
------------------------------------------

Consider that we have the following network where Distance Vector Routing run
and has reach a stable state where all the routers are known with the best
route. Which links must fail and which events must occur in order to have a
count to infinity problem between router B and E ?

 .. figure:: ../png/qcm1-4.png 
     :align: center
     :scale: 120

.. class:: positive

- links A-B, C-E and D-E must fail, then E could notice the failures with the link
  C-E and D-E. E update its routing table and its vector to [E=0, B=4, A=8, C=inf, D=inf]
  and sent it to its neighbors (B here). But the vector is lost. B, which
  doesn't have noticed yet the failure with the link A-B, sent its vector 
  [B=0, A=4, E=4, C=7, D=10] to E. After have send its vector, B notice the
  failure and update its table routing. The count to infinity appears when B
  and E start to exchange their vector.

.. class:: negative

- The link between B and E and the link between C and E must fail, then
  consider that all message sending by B and E are lost. B and E will have the
  count to infinity problem when receiving distance vector by A and D
  respectively.
 
- links A-B, C-E and D-E must fail then both B and E notice the failures
  exactely at the same time. The count to infinity problem begin when B and E
  start to exchange distance vector.


  
Question 7. Link State Routing
-------------------------------------------

Link state routing is the second type of routing protocols. When a router use link state routing, it sends message on the network. Wich of theses affirmations are corrects?

.. class:: positive

-
    A link state router sends periodically a ``HELLO`` message to all it's neighbourgs.

-
    A link-state router sends link-state packets to its neighbours. If this lsp is newer than the one stored in the link state database of the neighbours, they forwards the lsp on all links except the one over which the LSP was received.

-
    The Link state packet send by a router contains information only about the neighbours of this router.

.. class:: negative

-
    A link state router sends periodically a ``HELLO`` message to all it's neighbourgs. This ``HELLO`` message is forwarded all over the network.

-
    A link state router sends a ``HELLO`` message once when it boots.

-
    A link-state router sends link-state packets only to its neighbours. (They are not forwarded further)

-
    When flooding is used on a network, there is a link state database containing the most recent LSP sent by each router shared between all routers. 



Question 8. Differencies between Distance Vector Routing and Link State Routing
---------------------------------------------

Distance Vector Routing and Link State Routing are two different protocols. Find the correct affirmations.


.. class:: positive

-
    The link state routing uses a shorthest path algorithm.

-
    Distance vector are never forwarded.

-
    Link state packets contains the state of directly connected links.
    



.. class:: negative

-
    The count to infinity problem is found in both Distance vector routing and Link state routing.

-
    Distance vector are flooded on the entire network.

-
    A router that implement distance vector routing has a database where distance vector are saved.

-
    A link state packet contains information about the entire topology of the network. 

-
    The link state  database eliminates the need of a routing table.
