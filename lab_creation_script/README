This directory contains .py scripts which will let you generate netkit labs
from a network configuration given in a .dot file.

This directory was aimed to develop the different scripts, you will find the
same named directory in each netkit lab located to /labs with the .py you need
to generate the particular lab.

Basically, you will have each time the files : 

 - create_lab.py
 - create_[namedlab]_lab.py which is the only non-reutilisable file (correspond
   to a particular lab)
 - netkit_component.py
 - router.py or switch.py or ... any particular netkit_component (objects from
   these classes inherit from NetkitComponent object inside netkit_component.py)


What can you do with this script ? 

=> You can give to it a .dot file containing the representation of your
networks. The netkit lab will be generated from it and ready to work.

The synthax used in the .dot file is the DOT language (http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html)

Here's an example :

graph g{ 
  r1 -- r2 [weight=100]
  r2 -- r3
  r1 -- r4
  r4 -- r3
  r1 -- r5
  r1 -- r7
  r1 -- r6 [weight=10]
  r1 [zone="A"];
  r5 [zone="A"];
  r6 [zone="A"];
  r7 [zone="A"];
}

where you can easely guess which lines represent edges and which lines represent
nodes. The scripts handles 3 options for the edges: weight, delay and
bandwidth. they all must be integer. delay is in ms and bandwidth in kbits.

1 option is available for nodes. As you can see above, this is the zone option.
Setting a same zone for a bunch of nodes means that for the corresponding lab,
these nodes will be in the same collision domain. Of course, these node must be 
direct neighbours.

The script will handle itself interfaces and IP. For the exemple above, r1 will
be connected with the same interface toward r5, r6 and r7. If you don't want
one of them coming in the same interface in r1. Just remove its zone option. An
other zone will be given to it.
