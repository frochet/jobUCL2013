LABO 1: IPV6 network Instructions
=================================


In this lab, you will discover netkit, an emulator of networks. Here is given a
network configuration where 2 routers and 2 hosts are interconnected as you can
see below:
  .. figure:: labo1.png

     :scale: 100

Basic configuration is already done, interface and IP on each host is set. First, you will have to understand how works the ifconfig command used in the .startup files. Then you will have to create routes inside the network.

To manipulate routes inside the network, use the command route. You can use
this command in each virtual machine to manipulate routing tables.

After have set correctly all routes, you must be able to ping any machine in
the network (use ping6)

Enjoy !
